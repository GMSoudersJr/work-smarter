- data visualization
- one-click copy to clipboard
- keyboard shortcut to remove last entry
- toggle cases

## The Build

Built with [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/) from the ground up. Used the docs and tutorials to guide me through the new release. I was skeptical at first, but now I am back in love. Svelte has done it, again!
